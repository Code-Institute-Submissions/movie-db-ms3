## UX

### 1.1 Overview
* This project was started with the idea of introducing a wider audiences to movies they may not have heard of or seen before. I have always had a passion for films and wanted to try and share my own personal experiences with movies that other users may not have seen. I like the idea of a group of like-minded people supplying their own experiences to create a community introducing each other to their favourite, or least favourite movies. The simple design makes the information easy to read without being overwhelmed by lots of graphics and colours.

### 1.2 Project Goals
* I wanted to create a simple website that was focused on the films and the user's own experiences with those films. The simple colour scheme relies on a mostly grey and red as an homage to the colours of my own local cinema that I visit often. The website is designed to allow users to post a review of whatever movie they like, even if that movie has already been reviewed by another user. This allows the website to constantly evolve and change dependant on who is using it.

### 1.3 User Goals
* A user would want a simple intuitive design that is easy to navigate and pleasant to look at.
* A user would want a simple form to help them write their reviews in a structured way.
* A user would want to be able to post their review immediately for others to view.
* A user would want to be able to change their review at any time should their opinions change.
* A user would want to be able to remove their own reviews at any time.
