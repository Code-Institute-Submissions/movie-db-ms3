## UX

### 1.1 Overview
* This project was started with the idea of introducing a wider audiences to movies they may not have heard of or seen before. However the website is designed to allow users to post a review of whatever movie they like, even if that movie has already been reviewed by another user. This allows the website to constantly evolve and change dependant on who is using it. The simple design makes the information easy to read without being overwhelmed by lots of graphics and colours.
